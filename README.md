Chrome extension to remove the "Sell" button from the Robinhood site

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the files as a zip (recommended) or through git if you know what you're doing
2. Unzip the files
3. Go to (chrome://extensions)[chrome://extensions]
4. Click the `Load Unpacked` button in the top left corner
5. Navigate to the folder you just unzipped and click `Select Folder`
    * Note: if you get an error that says something like `Could not load manifest.`, make sure that if you click into the unzipped folder, you can see all the files. If you're just seeing another folder with the same name, select that inner folder rather than the outer one
6. You should be set! Go to (robinhood.com)[robinhood.com], and you shouldn't be able to see a button to sell your shares anywhere on the site
